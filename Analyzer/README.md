# Running analyzer
Analyzer is supposed to be run with at least one argument, specifying the
directory in which to search for notebooks. This must be the first argument. The
additional (optional) arguments can be used (in any order) to trigger different
analyzes:

* "-count"		:	Print the total number of notebooks and code snippets (cells).
